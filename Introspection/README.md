## a. Why must we choose you?
- You should choose me so that I could work with experienced people in the club and do a couple of Open source contributions. This is my first objective. My second objective is to do a couple of Deep Learning projects though I am a beginner in that. I want to upgrade my skills to maximum possible limit and I think amFOSS is the destination to achieve that.

## b. What is your plan for the next 6 months?
- I am so interested in Web-development and Deep Learning though I can only do one at a time. So,  I am planning to kick-start with Web-development then move on to deep-learning after a couple of web-development projects. I am planning to complete atleast 4-5 Web-d projects in next 6 months time, taking into account the contraints like, I am a beginner in web-d and the college academics.

## c. How would you contribute back to the club?
- I am planning to contribute to the club by doing many projects which would help the club grow greater heights. I am will also be very happy to work with people there in the club and gain more and more experience and be a master in any one area. I make sure that I will sincerely work for the club come what may and try my level best to prove my mettle in the club ecosystem.

## d. Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
- The selection process is indeed the best way to prove the fittest :muscle: among the candidates. Once a person clears the selection criteria by doing the tasks, he is already loaded with the weapons :crossed_swords: that is expected by the club(to some extent) and he should sharpen it by working on that repeatedly.
